          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <p>
            We are a team of passionate Computer Science undergraduates from CVR
            College of Engineering, driven by the mission to bridge the gap
            between healthcare accessibility and technology. Our project,
            <strong>"Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning,"</strong> is a
            real-time, field-based research initiative that leverages the power
            of artificial intelligence to provide users with quick, reliable
            health insights based on their symptoms.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h2>Who We Are</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Ashwith Reddy [23B81A05S2]</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Chaithanya Vodnala [23B81A05S6]</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Shiva Prasad Banda [23B81A05W6]</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <br />

          <p>
            Together, as <strong>Batch 14, Class CSE-E</strong>, we’ve developed
            a scalable, web-based health platform built on
            <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, and
            <strong>Machine Learning</strong> technologies.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            To offer a fast, accessible, and intelligent tool that empowers
            users with early health awareness through accurate disease
            predictions — especially vital in rural and under-resourced areas
            where access to specialists is limited.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h2>What We Built</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Select symptoms from a comprehensive list</li>
            <li>Receive instant predictions through a trained ML model</li>
            <li>
              View disease information and related precautions dynamically via
              EJS templates
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h2>Key Features</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Accurate Predictions:</strong> Using a model trained on a
              dataset of 132 symptoms
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>User-Friendly UI:</strong> Intuitive, responsive interface
              with secure login using Spring Security
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Performance-Oriented:</strong> Predicts diseases in less
              than 2 seconds
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Scalable Design:</strong> Easy integration into future
              health tech applications
            </li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <br />
          <h2>Our Vision</h2>
          <p>
            We envision a world where proactive health monitoring is simple,
            fast, and accessible to everyone — enabled by intelligent systems
            that provide actionable insights without needing immediate medical
            appointments.
